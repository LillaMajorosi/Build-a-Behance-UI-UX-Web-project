		The Birmingham Museum began as a private exhibition hall in the early 19th <br> century. At first it was one room in the free library, in which several dozen <br> photographs and copper statue of Buddha from the 1st century BC were <br> hung. Gradually, the museum grew, donated and acquired paintings, artifacts, <br> various collections, they occupied more and more premises in different parts <br> of the city, and in 1885 the Prince of Wales solemmly opened a new biulding <br> specifically for the museum and art gallery. The building was built in the <br> Victorian Baroque style.

		Above the museum and art gallery is a clock that the locals call Big Broom (brum is the <br>local term for the name of the city. inhabitants and dialect). The clock was donated to the <br>city by a researcher who measured meteorological and  chronological data in Birmingham. <br>The chime of the Birmingham clock is very similar to the chime of London's Big Ben, hence<br> its name.
		<br>
		<br>
		The art gallery has a large collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings, and there are more <br>paintings by Edward Burne-Jones than in other museums in the world. A large collection of<br> English artists from different periods. There are Flemings, and French, and Italians, and<br> Spaniards (Rubens, Botticelli, Murillo).<br>
		The museum belongs to the city council. Entrance to the museum and gallery is free.

		The memory of the wedding of Thetis (either a <br> sea nymph, or the daughter of the centaur <br> Chiron) and Peleus, a mere mortal, has been <br> preserved for centuries. No one before or since <br> has seem such a significant feast, which was <br> attended by almost all the Olympian gods.
		<br>
		<br>
		And the story that ended with the wedding began <br> long before that. Zeus, a great lover of women, <br> was inflamed with passion (for the umpteenth <br> time) for the pupil of his wife Hera, the young <br> and beautyful Thetis.

			And he would have taken possession of it, if not for the prediction of Promotheus that Thetis <br> would give birth to a son who would be stronger than his father. It was not at all part of Zeus's <br> plans for someone to overthrow him from the Olympic throne. And he decided to arrange the <br> wedding of Thetis with a mortal. This child will definitely not claim the Olympic throne.
			<br>
			<br>
			The choice of Zeus fell on Peleis. Although Peleus was a hero who followed the Golden <br> Fleece with the Argonauts and participated in the battle for Troy, he was still only a mortal.<br> And in order to intermarry with the gods, Peleis had to defeat Thetis in a duel. <br> And only then take her as his wife.
			<br>
			<br>
			The wedding of Thetis and Peleus was celebrated in the cave of Chiron on Mount Pelion in <br> the presence of all the Olympian gods. Well, almost everyone. One Eris, the goddess of <br> discord, was not invited to the wedding. By the way, this decision ended tragically for both<br> gods and people - the Trojan War began. But that's another story.
